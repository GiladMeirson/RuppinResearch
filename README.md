# Comparative Analysis of Human vs LLM Rankings on Stack Exchange Questions

## Project Overview

This research project is conducted under the auspices of the Ruppin Academic Center. It is led by Dr. Benjamin Bornfeld, with research assistance from Mr. Gilad Meirson.

### Research Focus

The study centers on comparing human-generated rankings of questions from Stack Exchange with rankings produced by various Large Language Models (LLMs). The human rankings are based on the principle of the wisdom of the crowd.

### Research Objectives

1. To investigate the alignment between LLM-generated rankings and human consensus rankings.
2. To assess the consistency of different LLM models in their ranking decisions.
3. To identify which LLM model most closely approximates human judgment across diverse question domains.

## Methodology

- Data Source: Questions from various Stack Exchange communities
- Human Rankings: Derived from user interactions on Stack Exchange (e.g., upvotes, views)
- LLM Rankings: Generated by multiple state-of-the-art language models
- Comparative Analysis: Statistical methods to measure alignment and consistency
